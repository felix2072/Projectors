Simple projector creation and modification for [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).

![Projector Add-on for Blender title image](/.github/gifs/title.jpg)

## What this Add-on can do for you
* Easy creation and modification of physically-based projectors.
* Real-world projector settings like [throw ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throw_(projector)), [resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_display_standard) and [lens shift](https://www.projectorcentral.com/Understanding-Lens-Offset-and-Lens-Shift.htm).
* Project test textures or your own content like images and videos.
* Preview the projections in Cycles render mode (Eevee will be supported when the needed functionality is implemented).
